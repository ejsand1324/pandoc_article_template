  abstract = {Background: Little is known about whether individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) experience any specific facilitators or barriers to driving education. Objective: To explore the facilitators or barriers to driving education experienced by individuals with ASD or ADHD who obtained a learner's permit, from the perspective of the learner drivers and their driving instructors. Methods: Datawere collected from33 participants with ASD or ADHD, and nine of their driving instructors. Results: Participants with ASD required twice asmany driving lessons andmore on-road tests than those with ADHD. Participants with ADHD repeated the written tests more than those with ASD. Driving license theory was more challenging for individuals with ADHD, whilst individuals with ASD found translating theory into practice and adjusting to "unfamiliar'' driving situations to be the greatest challenges. Conclusion: Obtaining a driving license was associated with stressful training experience.}

  abstract = {Background: For many autistic individuals approaching adulthood, interventions to promote skills toward independence are lacking. Driving is an important ability to cultivate as it may be a critical step to attaining independence, securing and maintaining work, and fostering relationships. Only about one third of able autistic individuals drive independently, and fear to drive is a common reason for not driving. Methods: This initial pilot study was a 3-month open trial to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial estimates of outcomes for the newly developed Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving (CBID) intervention, a manualized curriculum to enhance executive functioning (EF) and emotional regulation (ER) skill development for driving, combined with individualized commentary-based driving simulator practice, in autistic teens and adults within a community research environment. Nineteen participants received the CBID intervention in 1.5-hour group sessions for 10 weeks, across two cohorts, with approximately five individualized driving simulator sessions. Data were collected on anxiety symptoms, driving cognitions, driving attitudes, and simulated driving performance at pre- and post-intervention assessments. Results: Program completion rate was 81\%. Participants and parents rated both the intervention and simulator practice sessions with high satisfaction. All the participants (100\%) reported both a positive attitude change (interest toward driving) and a desire to drive in the future at the post-intervention assessment. Significant changes occurred for driving cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors, and 47\% of participants obtained a driver's permit or license by 2 months post-intervention. Conclusions: For autistic individuals, the CBID intervention appeared to directly impact the pursuit toward driving goals by both increasing driving attitudes and behaviors and reducing anxiety/apprehension. This highlights the need for driving intervention programs designed specific to autistic teens/adults that focus on EF and ER skills coupled with individualized simulator practice. CBID could be provided in community services to increase the number of autistic individuals driving. Lay summary Why was this study done? Driving contributes greatly to independence in many teens and adults. Anxiety can act as a barrier to that independence by affecting driving attitudes, ability and performance. Autistic individuals are often affected by anxiety, executive functioning, and emotion regulation challenges. Previous studies show that virtual reality training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), separately, can reduce driving anxiety in autistic individuals and support driving skills. However, to date, no studies have developed and tested a manualized intervention specific to driving that combines such methods. What was the purpose of this study? The goal of this study was to develop and test a group intervention, called Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving (CBID), combined with individualized, coached driving simulator practice to help reduce fears and increase cognitions, attitudes and performance towards driving. The study examined the following questions: 1) Do autistic individuals actively participate in CBID? 2) Do autistic participants like CBID? and 3) Are autistic participants more prepared to drive after taking part in CBID than they were before they participated in the program? What did the researchers do? After developing the CBID intervention with community member involvement, the researchers ran 2 intervention groups and individualized driving simulator sessions to a total of 19 enrolled participants. The group intervention focused on strengthening executive functioning and emotion regulation skills in 1.5 hour sessions over 10 weeks and 5, 1 hour driving simulator sessions. Researchers compared data on participant anxiety levels, driving cognitions, attitudes, and performance before and after the intervention. What were the results of the study? Most of the participants completed the program (81\%) and all (100\%) rated satisfaction with the group and simulator practice. All (100\%) of the participants changed attitudes towards driving. Participants had higher levels of positive thoughts about driving, better attitudes towards wanting to drive and less driving errors (like speeding, collisions, crossing lanes) on the driving simulator after completing CBID. Almost half (47\%) of participants obtained a driver's permit or license by 2 months after the intervention. What do these findings add to what was already known? This study adds a new option of an integrated approach, CBID, for addressing driving anxiety or apprehension. It provides initial findings of the value of incorporating executive functioning skills with traditional cognitive behavior therapy for enhancing driving readiness. What are the potential weaknesses in the study? This study contained a small sample size that was mostly white male participants. This limits generalizing the results to a representative diverse population. It also did not have a control group or use randomization which means that results can't be interpreted as causal at this time. There was no information about participants obtaining permit/licensure later than 2 months after CBID so it is unclear if some participants require more time to pursue a license. There was no follow up to understand if participants continued to feel comfortable driving overtime. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? This study showed that it's possible to combine virtual reality training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy into one driving readiness program. The new CBID program may help autistic adults by addressing multiple aspects of what they need to be ready to drive. Since the study used previously tested strategies, enrolled a community sample, manualized the program, and used a services approach, it was designed for broad distribution to other community settings.},

  abstract = {Driving is a neuropsychologically complex task; this can present challenges for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such asautism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Deficits in theory of mind (ToM) and executive function (EF) are common features of ASD and ADHD, respectively, and may influence driving processes such as hazard perception. No studies have directly examined the neuropsychological contributions to hazard detection among drivers with ASD compared to ADHD.In the current study, 48 participants ages 16-30~years (13 ASD, 17 ADHD, 18 typically developing (TD)) completed a driving simulator task in which they encountered hazards in the driving environment. Hazards varied in whether they were social (contained a human component) or nonsocial (were physical objects) to examine the contribution of ToM and social processing to hazard response. Additionally, participants completed a neuropsychological battery targeting ToM and EF/attention skills (cognitive tasks and self-report measures).Within the ASD group, participants responded relatively slower to social compared to nonsocial hazards; no effect of hazard type was observed in the ADHD or TD groups. Additionally, measures of ToM and EF were correlated with driving performanceamong ASD participants; within the ADHD group, only self-reported behavior regulation was associated with driving performance. Broadly, this suggests that cognitive factors such as ToM and EF impact driving hazard performance in ASD and ADHD. The results of the study have implications for developing driving intervention programs for individuals with NDDs.},

  abstract = {Driving is a cognitively challenging task, and many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle to drive safely and effectively. Previous evidence suggests that core neuropsychological deficits in executive functioning (EF) and theory of mind (ToM) may impact driving in ASD and ADHD. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study compares the brain mechanisms underlying ToM and EF during a hazard perception driving task. Forty-six licensed drivers (14 ASD, 17 ADHD, 15 typically developing (TD)), ages 16-27 years, viewed a driving scenario in the MRI scanner and were instructed to respond to driving hazards that were either "social" (contained a human component such as a pedestrian) or "nonsocial" (physical objects such as a barrel). All groups of participants recruited regions part of the "social brain" (anterior insula, angular gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right cuneus/precuneus, and right inferior frontal gyrus) when processing social hazards, and regions associated with motor planning and object recognition (postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, and supplementary motor area) when processing nonsocial hazards. While there were no group differences in brain activation during the driving task, years licensed was predictive of greater prefrontal and temporal activation to social hazards in all participants. Findings of the current study suggest that high-functioning ASD and ADHD licensed drivers may be utilizing similar cognitive resources as TD controls for decisions related to driving related hazard detection.

  abstract = {Over the past several decades there has been a surge of research on the contextual, biological, and psychological factors associated with transportation safety in adolescence. However, we know much less about the factors contributing to transportation safety among adolescents who do not follow a typical developmental trajectory. Adolescents with developmental disabilities (DD) such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have a wide range of behavioral and psychological deficits that may make the complex task of driving even more challenging. Because these adolescents often retain characteristic symptoms of their disorder into adulthood, it may impede their ability to achieve important milestones during the developmental transition from adolescent to adult. As the motivating force behind autonomous living and employment, the capacity for independent transportation is paramount to an adolescent's overall success. This critical review will draw from the current body of literature on adolescent drivers with developmental disabilities to determine (1) areas of impairment; (2) safety risk factors; and (3) effective interventions for improving driving safety in this vulnerable population of adolescent drivers between the ages of 15\textendash 22. This review will also identify important unanswered research questions, and summarize the current state of the literature.},

Prior to the assessment, participants completed the Driving Behaviour Questionnaire and measurements of cognitive and visual-motor ability. The driving simulation involved driving in an urban area with dense traffic and unpredictable events.; Results: In comparison with the typically developed group, drivers with autism spectrum disorders reported significantly more lapses in driving, committed more mistakes on the driving simulator, and were slower to react in challenging situations, such as driving through intersections with abrupt changes in traffic lights. However, they were also less likely to tailgate other vehicles, as measured by time-to-collision between vehicles, on the driving simulator.; Conclusions: The performances of licensed drivers with autism spectrum disorders appeared to be safer in respect to car-following distance but were poorer in their response to challenging traffic situations. Driver education for individuals with autism spectrum disorders should focus on quick identification of hazards, prompt execution of responses, and effective allocation of attention to reduce lapses in driving. Implications for rehabilitation Drivers with autism spectrum disorders reported significantly more lapses during driving. Drivers with autism spectrum disorders were observed to be poorer in traffic scenarios requiring critical response. Driver education for individuals with autism spectrum disorders should focus on managing anxiety and effective attention allocation while driving.

Methods: Fifty young adults with ASD and fifty seven typically developed adults participated in the study to form a contrasting group. Q-methodology was used to understand viewpoints on driving as a main mode of transportation. Data were analysed using a PQ by-person varimax rotation factor analysis. Results: Although some ASD participants perceived themselves as confident and independent drivers, others preferred other modes of transportation such as public transport and walking. Anxiety was also found to be a barrier to driving. The contrast group revealed consistent viewpoints on their driving ability. They preferred driving as their main mode of transportation and believed that they were competent, safe and independent drivers. Conclusion: These results are important in the planning of transport policies and driver training for individuals with ASD. Driver training manuals can be developed to address anxiety issues, hazard perception and navigation problems in the ASD population. Their use of public transport could be further facilitated through more inclusive transport policies.},

The failure to visually scan the driving environment and strategically search for potential road hazards, can be considered as unsafe driving practices. Little is known about how licensed drivers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) visually scan the roads while driving. The present study assessed the visual scanning and fixation patterns of drivers with and without ASD during a simulated drive.Methods: Twenty-eight licensed drivers between the age of 18-40 years old, including 14 drivers with ASD (male = 13) driving at least 2 h per week participated in a simulated drive with 14 matched controls. Psychometric profiles and visual scanning patterns on various objects of interest were analysed between groups.Results: Drivers with ASD were found to fixate and spend significantly more time focusing on the central visual field and less time scanning where hazards potentially emerge. They also tended to allocate less visual attention on social stimuli (i.e., involving a person), and failed to stop in time at the red lights. Psychometric profiles confirmed poorer visual scanning and motor processing speed but less risk-taking behaviour in drivers with ASD.Conclusion: Licensed drivers with ASD were found to allocate visual attention differently compared to licensed drivers without ASD. Poor scanning patterns with an over-focus on the road ahead and less scanning of the road side and periphery may possibly result in unsafe driving. However, risk-taking behaviour was not prevalent in these drivers. Effective visual scanning strategies could be incorporated in the driver training of individuals with ASD.},

  abstract = {Objective: We conducted an evidence-based review of intervention studies and predictor studies related to driving outcomes in teens with attention deficit?hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: Ten primary studies were classified using the American Academy of Neurology's criteria (class I?IV, I = highest level of evidence). We provided recommendations including Level A: intervention/factors are effective/predictive or not; Level B: probably effective/predictive or not; Level C: possibly effective/predictive or not; Level U: no recommendations. Results: For the intervention studies we identified 1 Class II and 1 Class III study; for predictor studies, we identified 7 ADHD studies consisting of 1 Class II and 6 Class III studies. Only 1 Class III ASD study was found. In synopsizing the evidence, the following recommendations are made for the intervention studies pertaining to on-road performance in teens with ADHD: a multimodal intervention is possibly effective in improving driving performance (Level C); stimulants possibly do not affect driving negatively (Level C); no recommendations can be made for hazard perception training in ADHD or ASD (Level U). Consider the following recommendations useful for simulated driving performance: Stimulants possibly improve driving performance (Level C); ADHD diagnosis and being unmedicated possibly worsen driving performance (Level C); no recommendations for driving in low-stimulus conditions (Level U). From self-/proxy report, no recommendations can be made related to gender or ADHD subtype affecting adverse driving outcomes (Level U).

The current study sought to gain a better understanding of driving and ASD by surveying parents/caregivers of adolescents/young adults with ASD who were currently attempting, or had previously attempted, to learn to drive. Respondents included 123 parents/caregivers of adolescents/young adults with ASD. The results indicate that learning to drive presents a substantial challenge for individuals with ASD; complex driving demands (e.g., multi-tasking) may be particularly problematic. Respondents provided suggestions that may be useful to others who seek to teach these skills. The survey results offer guidance for next steps in the study of driving with ASD.},

We compared objective rates of crashes, traffic violations, and license suspensions for newly licensed autistic and non-autistic adolescents.Method: This retrospective cohort study included New Jersey residents born from 1987 through 2000 who were patients of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia health care network. Electronic health records were linked with statewide driver licensing and crash databases. Autism status was classified via International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes; individuals with intellectual disability were excluded. We compared rates among 486 autistic and 70,990 non-autistic licensed drivers over their first 48 months of driving. Furthermore, we examined the proportion of crashes attributed to specific driver actions and crash types.Results: Compared with non-autistic drivers, autistic drivers were estimated to have lower average monthly rates of crash involvement (adjusted rate ratio (adjRR)~= 0.89, 95\% CI~= 0.75-1.05), moving violations (adjRR~= 0.56, 95\% CI~= 0.48-0.67), and suspensions (adjRR = 0.32, 95\% CI~=~0.18-0.58). Among drivers involved in a crash, autistic drivers were half as likely to crash because of unsafe speed, but substantially more likely to crash because of their failure to yield to a vehicle/pedestrian and while making left-turns or U-turns.Conclusion: Newly licensed autistic adolescent drivers have similar to lower estimated rates of adverse driving outcomes; the extent to which these can be attributed to different driving patterns is a critical point for future investigation. There were several notable differences in the characteristics of these crashes, which directly inform interventions to improve driving safety of autistic adolescent drivers.},

Kaplan-Meier curves and log-binomial regression models were used to determine the age at and rate of licensure, and estimate adjusted risk ratios. One in three adolescents with autism spectrum disorder acquired a driver's license versus 83.5\% for other adolescents and at a median of 9.2 months later. The vast majority (89.7\%) of those with autism spectrum disorder who acquired a permit and were fully eligible to get licensed acquired a license within 2 years. Results indicated that a substantial proportion of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder do get licensed and that license-related decisions are primarily made prior to acquisition of a permit instead of during the learning-to-drive process.},

Drivers with ASD endorsed significantly lower ratings of their ability to drive, and higher numbers of traffic accidents and citations relative to non-ASD drivers. Drivers with ASD also endorsed significantly greater numbers of difficulties on the following subscales: intentional violations, F(1, 162) = 6.15, p = .01, {$\eta$} p 2 = .04; mistakes, F(1, 162) = 10.15, p = .002, {$\eta$} p 2 = .06; and slips/lapses, F(1, 162) = 11.33, p = .001, {$\eta$} p 2 = .07. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD who are current drivers may experience more difficulties in driving behaviors and engage in more problematic driving behaviors relative to non-ASD drivers.}

  abstract = {A driver's license is key to independence for many young adults, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, individuals with ASDs may face special challenges when learning to drive. If effective driver training is to be devised for this demographic, it is important to determine the nature of these challenges. Driving inherently requires multitasking (e.g. steering, speed maintenance, navigation, hazard detection) and drivers are routinely obligated to combine driving with the demands of listening and responding to others, as occurs during driving lessons. Given that individuals who display traits associated with ASDs may have special difficulties with secondary tasks and especially those that involve socialization, we examined the effects of secondary tasks that involve listening and responding to questions while driving. We compared performance when simply driving (the control condition), driving while listening (the audiobook condition), and driving while listening and speaking (the prompt: answer condition). The autism spectrum quotient (AQ:Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, \& Clubley, 2001), a commonly used self-report questionnaire intended to measure traits associated with ASDs in research, was used to identify young drivers with more and fewer traits related to ASDs in a community sample, (None had a clinical diagnosis of ASD.) Consistent with studies of drivers clinically diagnosed with ASDs, we found that high AQ scorers reported greater mental and physical demand, effort, and frustration when driving, and showed more moment-to-moment variability in lane position and hazard reaction compared to low AQ scorers as measured in a driving simulator. Differences between the low and high scorers were typically largest when secondary tasks were imposed, but the predicted interaction between drive condition and AQ group only emerged in terms of steering variability.

Five feature generation approaches including statistical features, fractal dimension features, higher order crossings (HOC)-based features, power features from frequency bands, and power features from bins () were applied to extract relevant features. Individual differences were removed with a two-step feature calibration method. Finally, binary classification results based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and univariate feature selection method were evaluated by leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation to compare feature types and identify discriminative features.; Results: The best classification results were achieved using power features from bins for engagement (0.95) and boredom (0.78), and HOC-based features for enjoyment (0.90), frustration (0.88), and workload (0.86).; Conclusion: Offline EEG-based group-level classification models are feasible for recognizing binary low and high intensity of affect and workload of individuals with ASD in the context of driving. However, while promising the applicability of the models in an online adaptive driving task requires further development.; Significance: The developed models provide a basis for an EEG-based passive brain computer interface system that has the potential to benefit individuals with ASD with an affect- and workload-based individualized driving skill training intervention.},

Methods: Parents of teens aged 15 to 18 years with a parent-reported diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder enrolled in Interactive Autism Network, an online research registry, were eligible for this cross-sectional study. An online survey was used for data collection. Results: A total of 297 parents completed the survey. Sixty-three percent of teens currently drive or plan to drive. Twenty-nine percent of the teens who are age-eligible to drive currently drive. Compared with age-eligible but nondriving teens, a greater proportion of driving teens were in full-time regular education (p {$<$} .005), planned to attend college (p {$<$} .001), and held a paid job (p = .008). A greater proportion of parents of driving teens had taught {$\geq$}1 teen to drive previously (p {$<$} .001). There were no differences in gender, autism subtype, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, parental age or education, or access to public transportation. Driving predictors included individualized education plans with driving goals, indicators of functional status (classroom placement, college aspiration, and job experience), and parent experience with teaching teens to drive. Twelve percent of teens received driving citations, and 12\% of teens had been involved in a motor vehicle crash. Conclusions: Although a significant proportion of teens with higher functioning autism spectrum disorders were driving or learning to drive, the fact that most driving teens' individualized education plans did not include driving goals suggests an area of opportunity for improvement in transition planning. Driving teens were more frequently in regular education settings with college aspirations, which could help schools identify potential drivers.

Only two empirical studies have investigated driving performance in individuals with ASD-both employing proprietary driving simulation software. We designed a novel Virtual Reality (VR) driving simulator so that we could integrate various sensory modules directly into our system as well as to define task-oriented protocols that would not be otherwise possible using commercial software. We conducted a small user study with a group of individuals with ASD and a group of typically developing community controls. We found that our system was capable of distinguishing behavioral patterns between both groups indicating that it is suitable for use in designing a protocol aimed at improving driving performance.}

Methods: Systematic searches of eight databases identified 22 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. These studies were analysed in terms of the characteristics of the participants, methodology, results of the study and quality of the evidence. Results: Among the 22 studies, 2919 participants (364 individuals with ASD; 2555 parents of youth with ASD; mean age of person with ASD = 17.3) were represented, across six countries. Studies (n = 13) focused on factors affecting driving, including challenges in obtaining a licence, driving confidence, driving behaviours and strategies to improve driving skills. In regards to factors related to public and/or school transportation, nine studies explored rates of transportation use, access, cost and safety. Conclusion: Our findings highlight several gaps in the research and an urgent need for further transportation-related training and supports for people with ASD.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONMany people with ASD encounter challenges in obtaining a driver's licence, driving confidence and driving performance compared to those without ASD.Several strategies can be useful when teaching people with ASD to drive including direct communication, encouraging coping mechanisms, breaking down tasks and providing regular and consistent driving lessons.Clinicians and educators should advocate for further transportation-related training and supports for people with ASD.More research is needed from the perspective of people with ASD to understand their experiences and the particular challenges that they encounter in obtaining a licence and navigating public transportation.},

  abstract = {Background: Limited transportation access may curtail education, occupational training, social, and community engagement opportunities for autistic adolescents. Nearly one-third of autistic adolescents obtain a driver's license by age 21 years, which may increase mobility and improve autistic adolescents' transition to independent adulthood. This study examined driving instructors' perspectives and experiences of teaching autistic adolescents to drive to facilitate a safe learning-to-drive process. Methods: We conducted interviews with driving instructors with specialized training to teach autistic adolescents to drive. Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Semistructured interviews investigated family engagement; instructor observations; instructors' teaching strategies; and recommendations for improving the learning-to-drive process. A directed content analysis approach informed the development of a coding scheme. Coded transcripts were reviewed to identify themes. Results: We interviewed 17 driving instructors who primarily identified as occupational therapists. Key themes included importance of parent engagement; fostering independence; individualization of instructional strategies; and enhancements to the learning-to-drive process. Parent engagement prepared autistic students to undertake on-road instruction and supported skill development. While some families paradoxically limited adolescents' independence (e.g., heavy supervision while cooking, limiting participation in bicycling or lawn mowing) despite wanting them to pursue licensure, instructors believed that demonstrating independence in such life skills was necessary for safely undertaking on-road instruction. Instructors shared how they individualized assessments and tailored lessons over a prolonged period of time to promote safety and skill acquisition. Specific recommendations for enhancing the learning-to-drive process included standardizing instructional approaches and refining clinical assessment tools to determine driver readiness. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for parental engagement to support the learning-to-drive process and to foster the independence necessary to undertake highly individualized driving instruction. Efforts to increase families' access to tools to promote driving readiness and establishing best practices for instructors may enhance the efficiency and standardization of the learning-to-drive process.; Lay Summary: Why was this study done? Becoming licensed to drive increases the independence and mobility of adolescents, potentially improving access to educational, occupational training, social, and community engagement opportunities. Driving instructors are a critical resource for families, particularly for autistic adolescents who may receive training from specialized instructors, such as occupational therapists (OTs). However, little is known about the process and experience of teaching autistic adolescents to drive, which limits the ability to provide adolescents and families with guidance to prepare for and support the learning-to-drive process. What was the purpose of this study? The goal of this study was to examine the experiences and perspectives of driving instructors who provide behind-the-wheel training for autistic adolescents and young adults. What did the researchers do? We conducted semistructured interviews with specialized driving instructors who had experience working with autistic youth. Team members transcribed the interviews, coded them, and summarized common themes. What were the results of the study? We interviewed 17 driving instructors who primarily identified as OTs. Key themes included the importance of parents as partners, the need to encourage independence in daily living skills before driving, and the individualized approach used when working with autistic adolescents. Instructors provided suggestions for enhancing the learning-to-drive process and supporting nonspecialized instructors who also provide training to adolescents. Suggestions included enhancing the use of state-level Vocational Rehabilitation Services to provide financial support for instruction, use of a life skills checklist to identify and promote prerequisite driving skills, parent-supervised practice driving (including commentary driving where adolescents narrate driving instructions to a driver), and individualization of instruction tailored to adolescents' particular needs. What do these findings add to what was already known? These results inform efforts to prepare parents, nonspecialized instructors, and autistic adolescents themselves for undertaking on-road instruction and licensure. Instructors recommended that parents help adolescents develop independence, including skills to use alternative forms of transportation and practice predriving skills, such as navigation. Furthermore, these results highlight the need to establish best practices for instruction and refinement of tools and strategies used by both specialized and general driving instructors. What are potential weaknesses in the study? Our recruitment approach may have led instructors with similar training or opinions to participate, so important aspects of teaching autistic drivers may have not been elicited. We did not interview general driving instructors who may have different perspectives and needs that were not discussed. We were unable to determine how characteristics such as work location, race/ethnicity, or years in practice may have influenced participants' responses. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? Results from this study identify tools, such as a life skills checklist, and practice activities, such as commentary driving, that can be used by families to support autistic adolescents who are learning to drive. This study highlights the need to examine experiences with the learning-to-drive process from autistic adolescents and parents themselves to understand their needs and recommendations for enhancing the process of safely learning to drive.

  abstract = {Importance: In the transition to adulthood, driving supports independence. For autistic adolescents, training provided by specialized driving instructors, including occupational therapists, may establish fitness to drive and continued independence. Objective: To examine specialized driving instructors' experiences providing behind-the-wheel instruction to autistic adolescents. Design: We recruited participants through purposive and snowball sampling of members of ADED, the Association for Driver Rehabilitation Specialists. Interviews investigated experiences providing instruction, autistic students' strengths and challenges, strategies used, and recommendations to improve the learning-to-drive process. We coded transcripts using a directed content analysis approach. Setting: Telephone interviews. Participants: Specialized driving instructors (N = 17) trained as occupational therapists, driver rehabilitation specialists, or licensed driving instructors with recent experience providing behind-the-wheel training for autistic adolescents participated. Results: Behind-the-wheel challenges included mental inflexibility, distractibility, and difficulties with social cues and motor coordination. Instructors acknowledged students' strengths, including adherence to rules of the road, limited risk taking, and careful observations. Instructors scaffolded learning to help students develop skills. Although licensure and driving outcomes were sometimes unknown to instructors, students who became licensed frequently drove with supervision or restrictions. Conclusions and Relevance: Licensure is possible for autistic adolescents, although developing fitness to drive requires individualization and rigorous specialized instruction, which may culminate in delayed or restricted driving. What This Article Adds: This article highlights challenges and strengths encountered by specialized driving instructors teaching autistic adolescents. Despite requiring prolonged training, autistic adolescents can achieve licensure when supported by specialized instruction that is individualized to their needs and strengths.},

This study aimed to assess differences in simulated driving performance in young adults with ASD and typical development, examining relationships between driving performance and the level of experience (none, driver's permit, licensed) across increasingly difficult driving environments.Method: Participants included 50 English-speaking young adults (16-26 years old) with ASD matched for sex, age, and licensure with 50 typically-developing (TD) peers. Participants completed a structured driving assessment using a virtual-reality simulator that included increasingly complex environmental demands. Differences in mean speed and speed and lane variability by diagnostic group and driving experience were analyzed using multilevel linear modeling.Results: Young adults with ASD demonstrated increased variability in speed and lane positioning compared with controls, even during low demand tasks. When driving demands became more complex, group differences were moderated by driving experience such that licensed drivers with ASD drove similarly to TD licensed drivers for most tasks, whereas unlicensed drivers with ASD had more difficulty with speed and lane management than TD drivers.Conclusion: Findings suggest that young adults with ASD may have more difficulty with basic driving skills than peers, particularly in the early stages of driver training. Increased difficulty compared with peers increases as driving demands become more complex, suggesting that individuals with ASD may benefit from a slow and gradual approach to driver training. Future studies should evaluate predictors of driving performance, on-road driving, and ASD-specific driving interventions.},

This study examined how diagnostic symptoms of ASD and commonly co-morbid executive dysfunction relate to differences in simulated driving performance between young, inexperienced drivers with and without ASD. Participants included 98 young adults, ages 16-26 years, half of which were diagnosed with ASD. Participants with ASD completed the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and self- and parent-report versions of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) to confirm diagnosis and assess the severity of ASD symptoms. All participants completed neuropsychological tests measuring executive functioning. Driving behaviors, including speed and lane positioning, were assessed on a virtual reality driving simulator. Analyses were conducted to first examine relationships between autism severity and driving behaviors, and then to examine whether neurocognitive performance mediated differences in driving behaviors between young adults with and without ASD. Controlling for age, gender, and licensure status, ASD symptom severity was not significantly related to driving. Neurocognitive variables were grouped into three factors: Speed of Information Processing, Auditory Attention and Working Memory, and Selective and Divided Attention. Speed of Information Processing significantly mediated group driving differences. Results suggest that assessment of executive functions such as processing speed may be more useful than the diagnostic assessment of ASD symptoms for evaluation of driving readiness.},

Driving behavior, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking measurements were collected. The high functioning ASD participants displayed a nominally higher and unvaried heart rate compared to controls. With added cognitive demand, they also showed a gaze pattern suggestive of a diversion of visual attention away from high stimulus areas of the roadway. This pattern deviates from what is presumed to be optimal safe driving behavior and appears worthy of further study.

In this article, we describe exploratory research into barriers and facilitators in the process of learning to drive for young people with ASD. Questionnaires were distributed in three groups involved in this process: young persons with ASD, parents or caregivers, and driving instructors. Respondents were asked about their experience of the process of learning to drive and to give suggestions for improving current driving training. Furthermore, they indicated their perceived impact of specific characteristics often associated with ASD on their ability to drive. The results show that young persons with ASD have a good knowledge of traffic rules, experience difficulties in violating traffic rules when necessary, as well as with multitasking and responding to unpredictable situations, and display perfectionism. Moreover, they show a need for structure and more - but shorter - lessons. Driving instructors consistently perceived the impact of ASD-related characteristics higher than the other respondents. Several proposals for adjusting driving training were made which suggests the need for more systematic research and the propagation of new training methodologies. Finally, we highlight the need for an increase of attention, as well as of means and resources for research on certain groups such as ASD in transportation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This study aimed to investigate (1) if 16 young novice drivers with ASD exhibited a divergent performance on EF tests compared to 18 neurotypical peers, (2) if ASD participants exhibited a divergent driving performance compared to their neurotypical peers, and (3) if differences in driving performance would be related by the performance on the EF tasks. All participants completed a driving simulator scenario and computer-task battery. Driving error classification allowed the selection of several driving measures (e.g., collisions, speeding). Three EF tasks measuring working memory (WM), attention, and response inhibition were included. Results indicated lower WM and attention performance of the ASD participants compared to the control group, whereas response inhibition was similar across groups. Furthermore, the current study demonstrated that people with ASD can be considered as capable drivers once they have learned how to drive, that it is important to take different types of hazards into account, and that EF performance is related to driving performance. This relation may be different for drivers with and without ASD. Moreover, the relation may depend on the specific EFs and driving parameters under investigation. Future research could focus on the very early phases of driving education, and include additional driving and EF measures.},

The results show generally much greater variability and significantly poorer performance in the SDT and the TOVA for clients with ADHD/ASD compared with the control group. The SDT results were strongly intratest correlated, but had no interest correlation with either the UFOV test or the TOVA. The greater variability among clients with ADHD/ASD suggests greater effort and susceptibility to motivational issues and decline in sustained attention over several tests. In conclusion, the SDT is sensitive and has good face validity, and the TOVA is sensitive to neuropsychological aspects of safe driving. The SDT and the TOVA thus complement each other, and discrepancy between test scores calls for special consideration.},

Methods Participants with and without ASD viewed scenes that simulated self-motion towards a junction, while another car approached on a side road. Scenes terminated prior to either car reaching the junction and participants were required to decide which car would reach the junction first. Results Participants with ASD made fewer correct responses although this was only true when self-motion was on a straight road. Conclusions This difficulty in judging the location of moving objects could contribute to difficulties people with ASD experience in learning to drive. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {This study investigated whether individuals with ASD (autistic spectrum disorders) are able to identify driving hazards, given their difficulties processing social information, Klin et al. (Archives of General Psychiatry 59: 809-816, ). Twenty-three adult males with ASD and 21 comparison participants viewed 10 video clips containing driving hazards. In half of the clips the source of the hazard was a visible person (social); in the other half the source was a car (non-social). Participants with ASD identified fewer social hazards than the comparison participants ( U = 163.00, N = 44, p {$<$} .05) but not non-social. Participants with ASD were also slower to respond than comparison participants, F(1,40) = 4.93, p {$<$} .05. This suggests that, although people with ASD can perceive driving hazards they may have specific difficulty identifying them if they involve a person.},

  abstract = {Road safety issues often focus on behaviour and attitudes to driving in key age groups. However, underlying conditions such as Asperger Syndrome (AS) are not given enough consideration in the training and testing phase to ensure these road users are sufficiently equipped with the necessary skills to ensure the safety of themselves and other road users. The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders is approximately 62: 10000 at present. This is steadily rising as diagnostic methods are refined and awareness of the condition increases. This issue must be addressed urgently and infrastructure put into place to ensure this group of potential road users are taught and tested in the most effective way to address any road safety concerns. This report looks at the educational issues faced by this special needs group and the potential problems at the testing phase when attempting the provisional drivers test. Four case studies have been reviewed to see the real problems faced by supervisors and instructors during training and the strategies that can be implemented to decrease the risks associated for this road user group.}

Student drivers received ten driving lessons with a professional driving instructor via a standardised driving route. The Driving Performance Checklist was used as the outcome measure to evaluate the driving performance of student drivers during on-road pre- and post-observational drives. Both groups showed an improvement in driving performance, however, the extent of improvement between groups was not significant. Findings showed promising intervention efficacy for training student drivers with ASD to drive.},

  abstract = {Gaining a driver's license can be difficult for student drivers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet little is known about their experiences of learning to drive. In this qualitative study, focus groups and individual interviews were employed to ascertain the perceptions of three participant groups, including people with ASD, parents of people with ASD, and driving instructors with experience teaching people with ASD to drive. Participants in each group were asked to discuss their feelings, concerns, and barriers encountered while learning to drive, along with the driving behaviors, challenges, and strategies used when supporting people with ASD to learn to drive. Grounded theory analysis was used to shed light on the experience of learning to drive for people with ASD. Five themes emerged supporting the core construct that targeted support ameliorates intrinsic driving complexities, generating success: (a) challenges that increase the complexity of learning to drive, (b) external challenges to overcome, (c) concerns about the reality of driving, (d) the need for a specialized model of training, and (e) success is possible. These findings highlight the importance of developing an autism-specific driving training intervention designed for people with ASD, their families, and driving instructors.},

  abstract = {Gaining a driver's licence represents increased independence and can lead to improved quality of life for individuals and their families. Learning to drive a motor vehicle and maintaining safe on-road skills are often more difficult for people on the autism spectrum. Many countries currently have no autism-specific licencing requirements for learner drivers, and there is a general lack of ASD-specific support and training packages for individuals, their families, and driving instructors. This review synthesises the peer-reviewed literature about the driving characteristics of drivers on the spectrum and driver training available for the cohort. The evidence in this review showed that individuals on the autism spectrum drive differently from their neurotypical counterparts. There are shortcomings in tactical skills of drivers on the autism spectrum, but the extent to which this affects their own safety or the safety of other road users is unclear. Tactical skills can be improved through training programs. There are few autism spectrum-specific learner training programs available. Development of an effective training program will benefit individuals on the spectrum to learn to drive, be independent, and be safe on the road.},

  abstract = {A virtual reality driving simulator is designed as a tool for improving driving skills of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Training at an appropriate driving difficulty level can maximize long term performance. Affective state information has been used for difficulty level adjustment in our previous work. This paper integrates performance with affective state information to predict the optimal difficulty level. The participant's performance data, physiology signals, and eye gaze data are captured. The performance features and affective state features are extracted. Two classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are implemented to predict difficulty level. The results demonstrate that performance together with affective state information outperform the separated features in difficulty level prediction. A highest accuracy of 83.09\% is achieved with the integrated features.},
